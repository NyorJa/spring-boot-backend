- If you want to work on an issue, please request that it is assigned to you beforehand.
- If for any reason at all you decide to stop
  or find yourself unable to work on the issue anymore, **please** let me know.
  - I may be requesting updates if an issue gets stalled for too long, and eventually leave them unassigned

## Submitting pull requests

- Please use the GitHub web interface; we have a template set up for you to accurately describe your PR.
  - You don't _have_ to follow it by-the-book... But it helps everybody to give proper, well-deserved structure
    and description to changes in code, and PRs are great units to do exactly that.
